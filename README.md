# Temple Trashers

"Temple Trashers" is a couch co-op tower defense game, in which the towers you build can hurt you and your friends just as much
as they can hurt your enemies.
Build towers, aim them towards your foes and collect the crystals that drop in order to build more turrets and survive the
endless hordes of enemies!

The game is developed by the "Prosjekt: Spill" group of the Hackerspace NTNU student organization.
The project is open-source and free for all who are interested.
