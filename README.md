<br/>

"Temple Trashers" is a couch co-op tower defense game, in which the towers you build can hurt you and your friends just as much
as they can hurt your enemies.
Build towers, aim them towards your foes and collect the crystals that drop in order to build more turrets and survive the
endless hordes of enemies!

The game was developed by the "Prosjekt: Spill" group of the Hackerspace NTNU student organization over the span of 2 years.
The project is open-source and free for all who are interested.
For other projects and information, take a look at [Hackerspace's website](https://www.hackerspace-ntnu.no/).

In 2022, Temple Trashers was nominated for the "Most Innovative Game Design" award at the [Norwegian Game Awards](https://www.gameawards.no/)!
