# Right in the Temple

"Right in the Temple" (Working title), is a couch Co-Op Tower Defense game in which the towers you build can hurt you and your friends just as much as they can hurt your enemies. Build towers, aim them towards your foes and collect the crystals that drop in order to build more turrets and survive the endless hordes of enemies!

The game is developed by "spillprosjektgruppa", a project under Hackerspace NTNU. The project is open-source and free for all who are interested. For other projects and information, take a look at <a href="https://www.hackerspace-ntnu.no/">Hackerspace's website.</a>
