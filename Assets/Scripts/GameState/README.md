This directory is for storing scripts related to the GameState, which is logic tied to the abstract games systems of progression and handling events on a larger scale. Examples of this include Wave handlers, which is responsible for spawning variable enemies in variable waves at variable instances. More generally, logic tied to meta-things like handling game over screens can also be placed here.
