This directory contains scripts the can be applied to *any* game object to give those game objects extra attributes.

HealthLogic grants the game object it's attached to health points, the ability to be damaged, and makes it die when health points become 0.

DropLogic makes the game object it's attached to the ability to drop a prefab on death.
