  description: While I admittedly do admire her physical prowess, I do find her a
    bit intimidating. With me financing this expedition, partially atleast, I would
    expect my very reasonable orders to be followed. In contrast to our strongman,

    more dubious than I first assesed when hiring her as captain of the Sea Cow.
