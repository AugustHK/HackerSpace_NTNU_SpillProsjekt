  description: A true anomaly, it has the looks of an ancient mask, probably used
    for some long forgotten hedonistic purpose. The mask features som very peculiar
    properties. Seemingly endless amounts of impossibly hot liquid oozes out from
    it's orifices constantly. While our main priority is to bring this anomaly back
    for further study, it has proved indispensable as a heat source for preparing
    our rations.
