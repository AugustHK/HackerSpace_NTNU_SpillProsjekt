  description: Astonishing. Truly the uttermost curious object as of yet. This discovery
    will surely be ressponsible for sementing Dahl in the archeological hall of fame.
    I have already catalogued the object for transportation and sent word of this
    discovery... Protocol would require me to study the object in detail after shipping
    it back home, but surely, an immidiate quick examination won't hurt... surely.
