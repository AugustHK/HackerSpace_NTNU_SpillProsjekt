  description: A peculiar monument indeed. While I have yet to decipher the true
    purpose of this object, I infer it's purpose to be ritualistic in nature. While
    I can't prove it with my current equipment, the crystals at it's foundation seem
    to induce what I can only assume is electricity. I wonder if this might have
    some practical applications back home?
