  description: Incredible. It seems that there aren't just familiar skeltons that
    lay here, but also seemingle larger humanoids. These seem to have been here far
    longer than the smaller ones, as we've only been able to find them under heavy
    vegetation and soil. As of now I can only infer guesswork in terms of their age,
    but my current theory is that they are the ancient ancestors of the people that
    used to live here, thus explaning their more... aggressive features. With this
    in mind, I would estimate their age to be in the centuries, if not a millenia!
