  description: It was after our first archeolagical dig that we found one. At first
    we thought it to be a clay sculpture, but upon further inspection the material
    seemed far too durable. Furthermore, the material seem to be organic in nature,
    but somehow more akin to steel in strength than bone. Is this some heretical
    religious sculpture created through some unknown means? Was this once a living
    creature? Then surely not human in nature. As for it's age, I can't tell, but
    I must admit to an uneasy fealing of dread when contemplating, as if I've found
    something more ancient than civilization, nay even man himself.
